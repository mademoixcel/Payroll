# Business scenario 
It was on a Friday Afternoon when I logged in to LinkedIn to check my notifications and messages then I got this message from a startup founder.

Apparently, the company expanded in a short period of time and they haven't been able to keep track of their employee's payments for a month. So, guess who would be doing that? ME. 
Fast forward to Monday, we had a brief call to discuss in detail what the company wanted. I got the file after the call. It was in xlsx format. The data contained:

# Details of Dataset
1. Employee id
2. first name
3. last name
4. Gender
5. Department 
6. Amount earned (per hour)
7. Weekly hours worked

   
** Please note that I used a random generator to generate the Employee id, first name, last name, Gender,Department, Amount earned (per hour), and Weekly hours worked
